  <h1> Abstract </h1>
  <p>Depression is more common than it has ever been and our generation have made it clear how important mental health is. Life can feel like an uphill battle and confusing. I made a simple maze game reflecting life, constantly looking for solutions and the right way and hitting dead ends. The challenge shows how life is difficult and there are many options and routes to take. All you have to do is move forward and keep pushing, even when the "maze" seems never-ending. </p>
