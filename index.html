<h1>Welcome to my Portfolio</h1>
<p>
My name is Scottie and most of my coursework has been about media, marketing, IT, and a little bit of computer science. Despite taking a few classes with coding, I am very inexperienced and new to Github and looking to become more efficient on it. I am already proficient in many subjects like I mentioned earlier, I am looking to broaden and add to my skills.
